# Xero — The From-Scratch Web Platform

Xero is a **full-stack web platform** built entirely **from scratch** — no frameworks, no external databases, no shortcuts.

- Custom **HTTP server** in Node.js
- Custom **TCP server** acting as a key-value database
- Raw **HTML + TypeScript** frontend with manual DOM manipulation
- Core features: **Register**, **Login**, **Logout** with session management

## 🚀 Why Xero?

The modern web is full of frameworks and layers, but sometimes you want to go back to basics.  
Xero lets you:

- Understand the low-level mechanics of the web  
- Build and customize your own protocols  
- Gain mastery over the entire stack — from TCP packets to browser DOM

## 🧱 Features

- **Custom TCP Database**: Your own server that handles `SET`, `GET`, and `DEL` commands  
- **HTTP Server**: Handles routing, static files, and user requests  
- **Authentication**: Password hashing, session tokens, secure login/logout  
- **Frontend**: Written in TypeScript without any framework, communicating with backend via `fetch`
